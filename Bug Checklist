═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

----- Main UI -----

🔳 After every match an advert tries to play but doesn't. This also causes the cursor to lock automatically and disappear.
🔳 Max limit of claiming ad rewards per day is 3. But the popup shows up more than 3 times.
🔳 It takes too long to equip a skin in Shop inventory (about 5-10 seconds).
🔳 Multiple dances can be selected in the Shop inventory at once.
🔳 The resolution range in menu settings is 20-100 while for in-game pause menu its 50-100.
🔳 With the new Friends and messages system added and old one removed, you cannot see if the message sender is online or offline.
🔳 The inbox system also isn't live like before. This means, to see a new message from the sender you have to close and reopen the inbox again.
🔳 If you visit Shop/Leaderboard/Account/Settings and then come back to main menu, sometimes your equipped skin doesn't get applied. 
🔳 Custom match issues, if you don't join within 10 secs of creating a match then you get the alert "Session is not available!".
🔳 Daily Rewards alert "You already claimed your daily reward!" keeps popping up after every refresh.
🔳 You can claim daily rewards even without watching its advert.

----- In-Game -----

General

🔳 URLs like /?map=MapName and /Spectate:A1B2C3 don't work anymore.
🔳 When in-game resolution is reduced the HUD and crosshair resolution also reduces with it. This makes text harder to read and crosshair very blurry.
🔳 After a match ends and you vote for the next map, in the next game there is no hp bar over the enemies when you shoot them.
🔳 Players get stuck on the instancing spawn point below the map. You cannot find them anywhere on the map terrain. (attach ss)
🔳 Lighting issues on guns in official map jsons. Even if you turn around there's no lighting on the weapon and hands. (attach clip)
🔳 Lighting issues on the whole terrain. For maps with brighter skyboxes like Mistle and Tundra, there should be some amount of shadows.
🔳 Reflectivity problems. Most of the canvas elements are now reflective. Examples- Ground, MineCart, Character, Rocks etc. (attach multiple ss shortened iili)
🔳 For games (mostly guest lobbies while not logged in), you join at about 20-30 seconds remaining. This time should be at least 2-3 minutes remaining always.
🔳 Abilities and Grenade affect own teammates in TDM mode (Mistle).
🔳 Respawning after getting killed takes a very long time (about 10 seconds).

## Maps

🔳 Boxes within maps are extremely slippery and even worse in editor.
🔳 Trees don't have hitboxes on their leaves.
🔳 Directional cubic lighting bug. The light moves in a cube-like shape in the direction you face (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1103571515649310751/1103572477046702100/image.png)
🔳 Spamming spacebar on box edges makes you climb up them. Likely related to the boxes being slippery. (https://youtu.be/RgbDznCvy6M)
